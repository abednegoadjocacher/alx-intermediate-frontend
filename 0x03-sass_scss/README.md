# CSS Preprocessors: SASS/SCSS for Efficient Styling
This project is a practical introduction to SASS/SCSS, a powerful CSS preprocessor. The goal is to move beyond basic CSS by learning to use features that make stylesheets more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
 ## SASS Installation
 I have installed sass on my window machine
## Tasks:
- Use debug directive to print 'Hello world'
- Created a color variable and assigned it to html tags
- Nested related tags together to improve code readability
- Defined styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet using the __@mixin__ and use it by including it wuth the __@include__ directive. The mixin that I defined accepts two arguments.
